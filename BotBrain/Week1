
	ABSTRACT:

Exploring a big college campus such as Chanakya University is quite confusing for new students as well as old students at some point. 

	This project is about creating “Bot-Brain”, a campus navigation smart agent that makes it easy and quick for students to navigate the campus, with the help of technology and AI search algorithms. 
	Bot-Brain will graph out major buildings and places such as hostels, libraries, academic blocks, food court, cricket ground, volley ball court, canteen, gym, badminton court and others and utilize various pathfinding algorithms to recommend the most optimal routes to walk. 
	The agent will respond to queries like “How do I get from academic block II to library” or “How do I get from the hostel to the canteen?” and give required  building details, i.e., opening times or facilities available. For this, the project integrates a digital campus map, a number of search algorithms (such as BFS, DFS, UCS, and A*), and an easy-to-use interface where users can input their destinations.

The aim is to reduce campus life stress and guide the students to wherever they need to go, whether it's their classroom, cricket ground, canteen, nurse room or the library, in the most efficient manner possible.



1.	INTRODUCTION:

Wouldn’t it be great to have a smart tech to navigate through the shortest routes, like giving the students an overview of Chanakya university campus, and respond to queries in an instant?
This initiative launches “Bot-Brain”, a smart campus buddy that will enable students to navigate their university confidently. Whether one needs to know the quickest route to the cricket ground or food court or nurse room(with the medical services information), Bot-Brain employs search algorithms fueled by AI and a virtual campus map to guide users virtually as if they have a personal campus guide.
By doing this assignment, the process is not only about coding; it’s about making life on campus easier, friendlier, and much less bewildering for all students.


2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT:

New students and visitors at Chanakya University often struggle to find their way around the large and complex campus. Without a proper navigation system, many face confusion, delays, and difficulty accessing classrooms, offices, or facilities(like sports, medical, finance). There is a need for a intelligent navigation solution that can guide users in real time, suggest the best routes, and provide key details about campus locations to make movement easier and more convenient.



3.	OBJECTIVES: 
	Develop a comprehensive digital map: by representing buildings as nodes and routes as weighted edges (distances, with potential constraints such as one-way streets or pedestrian speed).   

	Implement several search algorithms: such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* - to discover and contrast paths between any two campus locations.


	Facilitate interactive query processing: Create a basic, interactive text-based interface in which users can input source and destination, choose the search algorithm, and get step-by-step directions with building information and estimated walking time.

	Implement basic location-based informational functionality: to present facility descriptions, opening times, and services available in every campus building.


	Compare and analyze algorithm performance:  through controlled experiments, reporting results, taking note of performance measurements and presenting actionable insights in report format.





4.	SCOPES OF THIS PROJECT:
(Also Future Scopes added which can be evolved later):

4.1) PRESENT SCOPES:

	Campus-Wide Coverage: Covers all major academic, residential, and other major spots to ensure anyone can easily navigate convenient routes across the campus.

	Flexible Algorithms: Utilizes various search strategies to acquire optimal routes between campus points.

	Detailed Building Profiles: Displays functional details for every location, such as opening times, facilities provided, and emergency numbers.

	Basic Text-Based Interface: Facilitates straightforward querying of routes and building details through an easy-to-use interface.

4.2) FUTURE SCOPES (which can be developed eventually beyond the given assignment goals):

	Conversational Interface: Delivers voice and chatbot assistance for natural, hands-free directions and campus inquiries.

	Visual Upgrades & Analytics: Integrates/applys interactive maps, real-time occupancy information.

	Extended Third-Party Integrations: Links with campus transportation systems, schedules, and emergency notifications for an integrated student experience.

	Scalability to New Locations: Scales the platform to other universities, larger campuses, and even city navigation.

	Advanced Search and Personalization: Merges smarter search features, personalized suggestions, and proper navigation options.

This project starts as a smart digital campus map for Chanakya University with plenty of space for new technology and innovation to continually enhance student life in the future.



5.	DOCUMENTS REQUIRED:

Define Campus Entities: Buildings & Locations: Provide a minimum of 12 notable locations frequented by students, including:
	Main gate
	Security gate
	Exit gate
	Academic Block A
	Library 
	Cafeteria
	Medical center
	Auditorium
	Academic Block B 
	Sports Complex
	Cricket ground
	Other sports court(tennis, volley ball, throw ball)  
	Hostel 
	Mini Mart
	Food Court

Map Physical Connections:
Pathways -  For every pair of linked buildings, showing the walking routes directly between them; Distances - Place realistic walking distances on each route (in meters). They can be approximated from an actual campus map or Google Maps' measure.

Collect Building Information: For each site, note basic and useful information such as -Opening and closing times (e.g., Library: 8 AM - 9:30 PM)


Functional User Requirements: Navigation Queries: User should be able to ask directions from source to destination and choose the desired algorithm.
Information Services: User may request information regarding any building and receive immediate, informative answers.

Data and Modeling Needs: 
Graph Structure: Code all buildings/nodes and paths/edges so that algorithms can walk on and compute best routes.
Sample Data: Create sample situations like “Find the shortest path from Hostel to Library”  for algorithm testing and verification.
